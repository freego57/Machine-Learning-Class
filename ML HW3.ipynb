While the cluster with lower quality has higher volatile acidity, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide and pH.

While the cluster with lower quality has higher fixed acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density and sulphates. Variables including citric acid, chlorides, pH and sulphates are pretty important to make a good bottle of wine as the average values of these variables in the 2 clusters are pretty different. The conclusion changed using hierarchical clustering and the two clustering method are giving different variables higher importance in dividing the observations."
